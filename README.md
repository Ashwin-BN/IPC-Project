# Veterinary Clinic System

## Overview
This project is part of my coursework for IPC144 at Seneca. The aim is to develop a comprehensive system for managing a veterinary clinic's patient records and appointment schedules. The project is divided into three milestones, each building upon the previous one to create a fully functional system.

## Milestones Overview
### Milestone 1
- Focus: Developing helper functions
- Task: Creation of core helper functions to aid in managing patient contact information and appointment scheduling.
- Implementation: Unit tester provided to verify functionality.

### Milestone 2
- Focus: Framework setup and patient management
- Task: Creating data structures and functions to manage patient records within the clinic system.
- Implementation: Integration of previously developed helper functions and extension of the system for patient management.

### Milestone 3
- Focus: Appointment management and data import
- Task: Further extending the system to handle appointment management, including importing data from text files.
- Implementation: Adding appointment-related functionalities, file reading capabilities, and refining the system.
